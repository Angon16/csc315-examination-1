\begin{enumerate}
  \item Most programming languages require the use of brackets to
    enclose the index in a reference to an element of an array.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify a language the requires the use of parentheses
      to enclose the index in a reference to an element of an array.
    \item Why did the designers of the language choose parentheses
      rather than brackets?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Ada
    \item Because the designers wanted uniformity between array references and function calls in expressions in spite of potential readability problems. 
    \end{enumerate}

  \item What is the relationship between a lexeme and a token?

  \begin{answer}

    A lexeme is a formal descriptions of a syntax of progamming languages and most of the times do not include descriptions of the lowest-level syntactic units. Each lexeme group is represented by a name or a token. So a token of a language is a category of its lexemes.

  \item
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What kind of symbols are found at the internal nodes of a
      parse tree?
    \item What kind of symbols are found at the leaves of a parse tree?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Non-terminal cateogires of the grammar are found at the internal nodes of a parse tree.
    \item Leaf nodes are labelled by terminal categories.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}


  \item One of the most significant contributions from the developers
    of ALGOL 60 also limited the success of that language. What was
    that contribution?

  \begin{answer}

    BNF, one of the most important contributions to computer science, is considered a simple and elegant means of syntax description but in 1960 it seemed strange and complicated and was a factor in its lack of acceptance.

    \end{answer}

  \item What problem were the creators of Common LISP trying to solve?

  \begin{answer}

    During the 1970s and early 198s, due to the usage of diverse dialects of LISP, there was a problem of lack of portability among the programs writting using different dialects. To solve the problem, Common Lisp was created by combining the features of different dialects of LISP.

  \item What is an ambiguous context free grammar?

  \begin{answer}

    A grammar that genereates a sentential form for which there are two or more distinct parse trees is said to be ambiguous.

    \end{answer}

  \item Contrast the complexity of algorithms that can parse strings
    that conform to the most general kinds of context free grammars
    and the complexity of the algorithms that can parse strings that
    conform to the grammars of programming languages?

  \begin{answer}

    Parsing algorithms that work for any unambiguous grammar are complicated and inefficient, the amount of time they take is on the order of the cube of the lenght of the string to be parsed. So generality is traded for efficiency. Faster alogrithms have been found that work only for a subset of the set of all possible grammars and the time they take is linearly related to the length of the string to be parsed.

  \item Java represents characters with Unicode. It is the first
    widely used programming language with this feature. What is the
    significance of this feature?

  \begin{answer}

    This feature includes the characters from most of the world's natural languages. It was developed because of globalization of business and the need for computers to communicate with other computers around the world.

    \end{answer}

  \item How does the binary coded decimal type differ from the
    floating point type?

  \begin{answer}

    Floating point data types model real numbers but the representation are only apprximations for many real values. Decimal types have the advantage of being able to precisely store decimal values, which cannot be done with floating point.

    \end{answer}

  \item Identify a user-defined ordinal type in the Java programming
    language.

  \begin{answer}

    Enumeration Types

  \item Mathematicians and programmers might have different ideas
    about the precedence of Boolean operators. Explain.

  \begin{answer}

    In mathematics, Boolean algebras have equal precedence, however, C-based languages assign higher precedence to AND than OR. This might have resulted from the baseless correlation of mulitplcation with AND and of additon with OR, which would then naturally assign higher precedence to AND.

    \end{answer}

  \item Programmers should use \verb+===+ rather than \verb+==+ to
    test the equality of the values of two expressions in JavaScript. Why?

  \begin{answer}

    Because whena  string and a number are the operands of a relational operator, the string is coerced to a number but when \verb+===+ is used no coercion is done on the operands of this operator.

    \end{answer}

  \item Describe a hazard of allowing short-circuited evaluation
    of expressions and side effects in expressions at the same time.

  \begin{answer}

    A language that provides short-circuit evaluations of Boolean expressions and also has side effects in expressions allows subltel errors to occr. Suppose that short-circuit evaluation is used on an expression and part of the expression that contains a side effect is not evaluated; then the side effect will occur only in complete evaluations of the whole expression. If a program correctness depends on the side effect, short-circuit evaluation can result in a serious error.

  \item Briefly describe the three steps in the mark-sweep algorithm
    for garbage collection.

  \begin{answer}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item{All cells in the heap have their indicators set to indicate they are garbage}
      \item{Marking phase-Every pointer in the program is traced into the heap and all reachable cells are marked as not being garbage}
      \item{Sweep phase-all cells in the heap that have not been specifially marked as still being used are returned to the list of available space}
    \end{itemize}

    \end{answer}

  \item What led Yukihiro Matsumoto to create the Ruby programming language?

  \begin{answer}

    Yukihiro Matsumoto's motivation was due to his dissatisfaction with Perl and Python, which support object-oriented programming but neither is puer object oriented langauge.

    \end{answer}

  \item What did Microsoft aim to achieve with its development of the
    C\# language?

  \begin{answer}

    The purose of C\# is to provide a language for componenet based software development. In this environment, components from a variety of languages can be easily combined to form systems. 

    \end{answer}
