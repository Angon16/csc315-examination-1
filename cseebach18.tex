\begin{enumerate}
  \item Most programming languages require the use of brackets to
    enclose the index in a reference to an element of an array.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify a language the requires the use of parentheses
      to enclose the index in a reference to an element of an array.
    \item Why did the designers of the language choose parentheses
      rather than brackets?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The original FORTRAN used parentheses to to enclose an array
      reference.
    \item At the time FORTRAN was first introduced, keypunch machines did not
      include the square bracket keys.

  \item What is the relationship between a lexeme and a token?

  \begin{answer}
    Lexemes and tokens are both produced by the lexer. A lexeme is a string that
    makes up some symbol in the language, while a token describes a whole
    category of lexemes.

    For example, an identifier lexeme is commonly a string of characters a-z and
    underscore. Regardless of what characters are chosen, the token is still
    identifier.

  \item
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What kind of symbols are found at the internal nodes of a
      parse tree?
    \item What kind of symbols are found at the leaves of a parse tree?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Non-terminal symbols are found at the internal nodes of a parse tree.
    \item Terminal symbols are found at the leaves of a parse tree. All the
      non-terminals have been replaced at the leaves of the tree.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item One of the most significant contributions from the developers
    of ALGOL 60 also limited the success of that language. What was
    that contribution?

  \begin{answer}

    Backus-Naur form described the syntax of ALGOL 60 in a way that was new
    and unfamiliar at the time.
