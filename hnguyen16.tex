\begin{enumerate}
  \item Most programming languages require the use of brackets to
    enclose the index in a reference to an element of an array.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify a language the requires the use of parentheses
      to enclose the index in a reference to an element of an array.
    \item Why did the designers of the language choose parentheses
      rather than brackets?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The languages are pre-90 Fortrans and PL/I
    \item Because there were no other suitable characters available at the time. Card punches did not include bracket characters.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item What is the relationship between a lexeme and a token?

  \begin{answer}

    Lexemes are the lowest-level syntactic units. A token of a language is a category of its lexemes.

  \item
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What kind of symbols are found at the internal nodes of a
      parse tree?
    \item What kind of symbols are found at the leaves of a parse tree?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Nonterminal symbols are found at the internal nodes of a parse trees.
    \item Terminal symbols are found at the leaves of a parse trees.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}


  \item One of the most significant contributions from the developers
    of ALGOL 60 also limited the success of that language. What was
    that contribution?

  \begin{answer}

    It was the use of BNF as the formal means of describing syntax. In 1960 it seemed strange and complicated.

    \end{answer}

  \item What problem were the creators of Common LISP trying to solve?

  \begin{answer}

    During the 1970s and early 1980s, a large number of different dialects of LISP were developed and used. This led to the familiar problem of lack of portability among programs written in the various dialects. Common LIPS was created to rectify the situation by combining the features of several dialects of LISP, including Scheme, into a single language.

  \item What is an ambiguous context free grammar?

  \begin{answer}

    An ambiguous grammar is a grammar that generates a sentential form for which there are two or more distinct parse trees. Context-free grammars were developed by Noam Chomsky as a class of natural languages, but became the primary method through which the syntax of programming languages are described. 

    \end{answer}

  \item Contrast the complexity of algorithms that can parse strings
    that conform to the most general kinds of context free grammars
    and the complexity of the algorithms that can parse strings that
    conform to the grammars of programming languages?

  \begin{answer}

Algorithms that can parse general kinds of context-free grammars have a cubic time complexity. But the grammars of programming languages are far less general and only a subset of general context-free grammars. Algorithms to parse them have O(n), or linear time complexity, which is more efficient.    

    \end{answer}

  \item Java represents characters with Unicode. It is the first
    widely used programming language with this feature. What is the
    significance of this feature?

  \begin{answer}

    Unicode includes the characters from most of the world's natural languages. Before Unicode was created, the 8-bit code ASCII was used to code character data and became inadequate for communication with computers around the world.

    \end{answer}

  \item How does the binary coded decimal type differ from the
    floating point type?

  \begin{answer}

    Floating-points store only approximations for many real values, while decimals store precise decimal values up to a specific range. Floating-point values are represented as fractions and exponents, typically taking 32 bits. Binary-coded decimals store one to two digits per byte, since a digit takes at least 4 bits, so they take up a lot of storage. 

    \end{answer}

  \item Identify a user-defined ordinal type in the Java programming
    language.

  \begin{answer}

    The java user-defined ordinal type is Enum. All enumeration types in Java are implicitly subclasses of the predefined class Enum.

    \end{answer}

  \item Mathematicians and programmers might have different ideas
    about the precedence of Boolean operators. Explain.

  \begin{answer}

    In the mathematics of Boolean algebras, the OR and AND operators must have equal precedence. However, the C-base languages assign a higher precedence to AND than OR. 

    \end{answer}

  \item Programmers should use \verb+===+ rather than \verb+==+ to
    test the equality of the values of two expressions in JavaScript. Why?

  \begin{answer}

    \verb+===+ prevents Javascript operands from being coerced, and in effect checks for type equivalence. For example, ``7'' \verb+==+ 7 evaluates to true in Javascript, while ``7'' \verb+===+ 7 evaluates to false.

    \end{answer}

  \item Describe a hazard of allowing short-circuited evaluation
    of expressions and side effects in expressions at the same time.

  \begin{answer}

    Allowing both at the same time may lead to errors where the side effect is part of the second boolean expression, and is not evaluated due to the expression having been short-circuited after the first.

    \end{answer}

  \item Briefly describe the three steps in the mark-sweep algorithm
    for garbage collection.

  \begin{answer}

    First, all cells in the heap are marked as garbage. Second, every pointer is traced into the heap, and mark all cells they reach as not-garbage. Finally, all cells still marked as garbage are returned to the list of available space.

    \end{answer}

  \item What led Yukihiro Matsumoto to create the Ruby programming language?

  \begin{answer}

    Matsumoto was dissatisfied with Perl and Python, which were not pure object-oriented languages.

    \end{answer}

  \item What did Microsoft aim to achieve with its development of the
    C\# language?

  \begin{answer}

    As the flagship language of .NET and Microsoft, C\# was meant to allow .NET to combine components written in all other .NET languages, such as Visual Basic and C++.

    \end{answer}
