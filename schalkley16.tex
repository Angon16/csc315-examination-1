\begin{enumerate}
  \item Most programming languages require the use of brackets to
    enclose the index in a reference to an element of an array.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify a language the requires the use of parentheses
      to enclose the index in a reference to an element of an array.
    \item Why did the designers of the language choose parentheses
      rather than brackets?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item the language that requires the use of parentheses to enclose
      an index is ada.
    \item the designers chose parentheses to enclose subscripts so
      there would be uniformity between array references and function
      calls in expressions.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}
    
  \item What is the relationship between a lexeme and a token?

  \begin{answer}

    the lexemes of a programming language include numeric literals
    operators and special words. these are partitioned into
    groups. the token is the name that represents each lexeme
    group. (a token of a language is a category of its lexemes.)

    \end{answer}

  \item
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What kind of symbols are found at the internal nodes of a
      parse tree?
    \item What kind of symbols are found at the leaves of a parse tree?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item nonterminal symbols are at every internal node
    \item leaves of the parse tree is labeled with a terminal symbol
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}


  \item One of the most significant contributions from the developers
    of ALGOL 60 also limited the success of that language. What was
    that contribution?

  \begin{answer}

   This is what is called static scopping it is a method of binding
   names to nonlocal variables. the scope of the variable can be
   statically determined prior to execution.
    \end{answer}

  \item What problem were the creators of Common LISP trying to solve?

  \begin{answer}

  it was created to solve lack of portability among programs written
  in the various dialects

    \end{answer}

  \item What is an ambiguous context free grammar?

  \begin{answer}
    a grammarthat generates a sentential form where there are two or
    more distinct parse trees.
        \end{answer}

  \item Contrast the complexity of algorithms that can parse strings
    that conform to the most general kinds of context free grammars
    and the complexity of the algorithms that can parse strings that
    conform to the grammars of programming languages?

  \begin{answer}

    the conplexity for parsing strings that conform to general kinds
    of context free grammers is $O(n^3)$ which is alot and takes
    awhile. while parsing strings that conform to grammars have a
    complexity of $O(n)$ which is much faster. this indicates that it is
    linear. and much more efficient

  \item Java represents characters with Unicode. It is the first
    widely used programming language with this feature. What is the
    significance of this feature?

  \begin{answer}

  Unicode is standard for character incoding. this allowed computers
  to communicate with comuters around the world. this helped with
  globalization of business because of the demand of computers talking
  to comuters around the world.

    \end{answer}

  \item How does the binary coded decimal type differ from the
    floating point type?

  \begin{answer}

  uses binary codefor the decimal digits ( much like strings.) this
  allows precision storing of decimal values. supports business
  proccessing etc.  on the other hand floating points are only
  approximations for many real values. has some problems like loss of
  accuracy throug arithmetic operations

    \end{answer}

  \item Identify a user-defined ordinal type in the Java programming
    language.

  \begin{answer}

   this is an enumeration. 

    \end{answer}

  \item Mathematicians and programmers might have different ideas
    about the precedence of Boolean operators. Explain.

  \begin{answer}

   in math booleans or/ and must have equal precedence.  however with
   computer science, specifically in c we establish a higher
   precedence in and than or.

    \end{answer}

  \item Programmers should use \verb+===+ rather than \verb+==+ to
    test the equality of the values of two expressions in JavaScript. Why?

  \begin{answer}

    because this === prevents operands from being coerced.in this case
    === with a string and number would turn out false.

    \end{answer}

  \item Describe a hazard of allowing short-circuited evaluation
    of expressions and side effects in expressions at the same time.

  \begin{answer}

   short circut evaluation can be hazardus when used on and expression
   and part of an expression that contains a side effect is not
   evaluated.  for example $(a > b) || ((b++ / 3)$ if the programmer
   assumed b would change every time and a was not greater than b the
   program would fail.

    \end{answer}

  \item Briefly describe the three steps in the mark-sweep algorithm
    for garbage collection.

  \begin{answer}

  1) all cells in the heap have their indicators set to indicate they
  are garbage 2) marking phase, every pointer is traced into the heap
  and all reachable cells are marked as not being garbage 3)sweep
  phase, all cells in the heap that have not been specifically marked
  as still being used are returned to the list of available space.

    \end{answer}

  \item What led Yukihiro Matsumoto to create the Ruby programming language?

  \begin{answer}

   the motivation for ruby was dissatisfaction of its designer with
   perl and python.  niether was a pure object-oriented language in
   the sense that each hase primitive types and each supports
   functions.

    \end{answer}

  \item What did Microsoft aim to achieve with its development of the
    C\# language?

  \begin{answer}

   the C\# designers obviously disagreed with this wholesale removal of
   featurs that java did not include. it included all but the multiple
   inheritance. they wanted to have a language for component based
   software development (looking alot at .NET)


    \end{answer}

  \end{enumerate}
